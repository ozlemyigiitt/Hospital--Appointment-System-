# Hospital--Appointment-System-

The aims and needs of the project were determined. The project also aimed to provide the user with the best possibilities. The ease of design is designed to be the most comfortable. The interface was created in the NetBeans program. Tables were adapted to the program with MY SQL Server.

Components and Tasks of the Project
•	Patient Login
•	Doctor Login
•	Clinic
•	Patient Registration
•	Password Update
•	Choosing Date and Time and a Doctor
•	Confirmation Screen

My hospital automation system that I will design consists of two parts;
Patient Login
In this section, the user can login with the ID number and password. Also, I tried to design my designed LOGINPAGE form so that the user can focus. For example, colors, design and contents.
This focus,it enables users to adapt to this system more comfortably and to increase its usage.
There are also New Account, Remember ME and Forget Password sections in the LOGINPAGE form.
